We painted our faces
We were at resting place in for the light
I must admit on that resting site
We looked alright

But now it's just traces
As we fade in black and white
We put makeup on with no light
We're too uptight (too uptight with you, too uptight)

Color me this way
Color me that way
Color me inside out
Color me upside down
